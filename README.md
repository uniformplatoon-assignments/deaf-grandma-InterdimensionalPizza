# Deaf Grandma

This small challenge comes from Chris Pine's "Learn to Program". Ensure that you read everything and click every link before starting the work.
 
## Premise

Write a program which can imitate a Grandma who's hard of hearing and follows
these constraints:

* If you don't input anything (just hit enter) she responds with `WHAT?!`
* If you ask a question with any lower-case letters, she responds with
`SPEAK UP, KID!`
* If you talk to her in all upper-case letters, she responds with
`NO, NOT SINCE 1946!`

* The first time you say `GOODBYE!` she says `LEAVING SO SOON?`
* The second time you say `GOODBYE!` she says `LATER, SKATER!` and the program
exits.

## Example

```
HEY KID!
> hi, grandma
SPEAK UP, KID!
> I SAID HI, GRANDMA
NO, NOT SINCE 1946!
>
WHAT?!
> Goodbye!
SPEAK UP, KID!
> GOODBYE!
LEAVING SO SOON?
> GOODBYE!
LATER, SKATER!
```
