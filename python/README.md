## Considerations (Python)

To run the program: `python deaf_grandma.py`

* Remember that `input()` is the "inverse" method of `print()` -- while `print()` outputs information to the terminal, `input('command Prompt')` captures information from the user by presenting a command prompt and allowing them to type input.
* If you have an infinite loop, how might you break out of it?
